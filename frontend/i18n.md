in first install install the CLI and its platform-server:
npm install @angular/compiler-cli @angular/platform-server --save
it may be necessary also to install the typings pack
sudo npm install typings --global --save
but now it doesn't fix the i18n tool((
./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n
may execute with not small list of errors however it produce the correct messages.xlf file
so, edit it... And from this point be worry about your translation! Further ng-xi18n execution provide fresh (with empty target tag) messages.xlf file!
In this case it may be good to "mv messages.xlf translate.xlf" am then merge new nodes from messages.xlf in some tool like a meld after each ng-xi18n execution.
In my opinion it is better to continue to use our translation map to resolve json keys and hardcode the rus words in the template till developers make stable i18n tool
